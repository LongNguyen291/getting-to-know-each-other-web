<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Long.
     I thought about using a different name before coming here in the US but realized that I'm 
     still most comfortable with the name my parents have given me.
    I'm from Vietnam, in a family of five, with three siblings. I got the chance to come to
     study in the US for 9 months prior to coming to Lewis.
 My major is Computer Science.</p>

 <h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Class</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Basics of Coding</li>
    <li>The Barebones of Websites, Software and Such</li>
    <li>Data Security</li>

 </ul>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like to spend time drawing. Apart from paying attention to class and schoolwork, I practice drawing as well.
    It's something I'm quite passionate about, but not every time that it is enjoyable. So other than drawing, I would play videogames
    as a way to relieve my stress, I prefer playing with friends too.
</p>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>A fun fact about myself is I still play Roblox once in a while to bully kids in competitive games</p>
